CRF video blogs (2014-15) CRF blogs (2014-15) Multicultural Resource Guide The OSU Multicultura Resource Guide is a dynamic web-based resource guide providing students, staff, and faculty a centralized place to obtain information on hard-to-find resources. The hope is that this would be specifically useful for students, staff, and faculty who are new to OSU and looking for information on services and resources that are otherwise difficult to find. An example of a commonly reported challenge would be an African-American woman looking for hair care services in Corvallis. The resources are not only local services or businesses but also campus resources. OSU Multicultural Resource Guide UHDS Multicultural Resource Library The UHDS Multicultural Resource Library is filled with a variety of films and books. The library consists of feature films, documentaries, video clips, books, and novels that are available to borrow for professional development as well as utilized during CRF facilitations.
