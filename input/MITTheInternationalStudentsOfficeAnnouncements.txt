Danielle was devoted to each and every one of you. Despite her serious illness, Danielle worked relentlessly at what she loved most - serving international students, and making a difference in their lives. She was an example to us all, and we will continue in her footsteps in our devotion to you all. Please know that we are always here for you. You can contact any of us, in person, by phone or email. Our doors are open for you tomorrow and after to grieve, share, and celebrate Danielle. We will have a Book of Condolence available in the ISO reception for you to sign, if you wish, which will be sent to the Ashbrook family. Always remember how special you were to Danielle. http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2014/danielle-guichard-ashbrook-obituary With sincere gratitude, and feelings of deep sadness, Maria, Antoinette, Aurora, Carlene, Emily, Janka, Joycelyn, Mayoka, and Sylvia MIT International Students Office 77 Massachusetts Avenue, E39-278 Cambridge, MA 02139 617-253-3795 web.mit.edu/iso | iso-help@mit.edu *Please note that the ISO will be open, as usual, on Monday, November 10, but will be closed on Tuesday, November 11 for Veteran's day.
