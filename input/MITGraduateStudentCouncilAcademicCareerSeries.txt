Several offices and individuals have joined forces to pull together an award winning series of seminars designed to illuminate the academic life to MIT’s graduate student and post-doc communities. Our collaborators are: MIT Career Development Center MIT Postdoc Advisory Council This panel series was recognized with an achievement award at the 17th Annual Conference of the National Association of Graduate-Professional Students, held in St. Louis, in November 2002. Currently this series has two parts: “Academia, Industry, or Both” and “The Nuts and Bolts of an Academic Job Search”, with plans of adding another part related to postdoctoral job search and fellowships in the coming summer. This series has been merged with the more general-purpose Professional Development Series—so please check its webpage for more details about these panels.   Events & Meetings  MIT Earth Days Tuesday, April 21 12:00am - 11:59pm GSC Sustinability Meeting Tuesday, April 21 5:00pm - 6:00pm MIT Earth Days Wednesday, April 22 12:00am - 11:59pm MIT Earth Days Thursday, April 23 12:00am - 11:59pm MIT Earth Days Friday, April 24 12:00am - 11:59pm   Work-Related News  Nominations: Working Group on Electronic Records Call for Applications: Working Group on th...
