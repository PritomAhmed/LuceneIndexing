The committee?s work focuses on ensuring that the MIT graduate experience is enjoyable, affordable, safe, healthy, and marked by a welcoming community. A large portion of the work carried out by the HCA is done through a set of subcommittees, each of which focuses on a particular aspect of student life. To find out more, please feel free to contact the HCA committee chairs at gsc-hca[at]mit[dot]edu, or attend the next meeting.
