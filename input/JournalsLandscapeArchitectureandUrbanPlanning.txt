Journals Journals International Journal of Mass Emergencies and Disasters Editor-In-Chief, Dr. Michael Lindell The International Journal of Mass Emergencies and Disasters is published triannually during the months of March, August, and November. It is concerned with the social and behavioral aspects of relatively sudden collective stress situations typically referred to as disasters or mass emergencies. All aspects of the life history of such events, both actual and threatened, are examined including mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery activities. These situations often are created by natural disaster agents, technological accidents, violent intergroup conflicts, shortages of vital resources, acute and chronic environmental threats, and other kinds of major hazards to life, health, property, well-being, and everyday routines. Natural Hazards Review Associate editor, Dr. Walt Peacock Natural Hazards Review provides innovative and practical solutions to the problems and challenges faced by all sectors of the hazards community, including government, academia, the private sector, and non-governmental organizations. The journal publishes original, peer-reviewed papers on every aspect of loss reduction. Articles containing detailed case studies are complemented by ones reporting original research findings to describe both practical projects and the latest cutting-edge knowledge on significant hazards issues. The Journal of the Southeast Chapter of the Society of Architectural Historians, ARRIS Co-editors, Nancy Volkman & Dr. Anat Geva ARRIS publishes articles dealing with the history of architecture, landscape architecture, urban planning, public works, building construction and historic preservation, and related subjects. It is peer-reviewed and published annually in the fall. Papers for consideration are accepted until early January of the year of publication. See the ARRIS website at http://www.sesah.org/1pubs.html for details of paper requirements. © 2015 College of Architecture, Texas A&M University. Contact Information | Accessibility | Site Policies
