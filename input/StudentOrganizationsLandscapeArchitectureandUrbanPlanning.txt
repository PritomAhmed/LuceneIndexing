The planning profession is multidisciplinary and so are our students. Our goals as an organization are to welcome new students into the program, coordinate social events, fundraise for conferences, and promote networking between students and professionals. We encourage the members of the association to participate in committees and social events as well as attend the conferences. Our association has some of the best planners in the country and across the world and we invite you to contact any one of the officers if you would like any more information.

SEED - Social, Economic, & Environmental Design Shannon Van Zandt, Advisor Website: http://chud.arch.tamu.edu/education/seed-student-organization/ URSSO-Urban and Regional Science Students Organization This fall, URSSO plans to have some of the following: Welcome for new students— mini-orientation for new Ph.D students (we would love to have volunteers to help!). A few social events like playing frisbee in the park and other opportunities in the first two-three weeks of school to meet, hang out, get reacquainted with each other. An unofficial student handbook on all the things that people will tell you about your Ph.D program—preparing for your preliminary exams, forms that are necessary, degree plans, forming a committee, staying on track with your research, funding sources, and more! We may not have the answers—but at least we will be able to tell you what you should ask...
