Twahirwa Ken Wilson Asia Wyatt CONVERGE Conferences Resources Khalil Hill Faculty Mentor: Michael Short Direct Supervisor: Michael Short Home University: Pennsylvania State University Academic Department: Nuclear Science and Engineering Biography My name is Khalil Hill and I am a rising sophomore nuclear engineering major at Penn State University. I am extremely interested in the nuclear energy field as I hope to play a part in solving the world energy crisis. I truly believe that nuclear energy will be incredibly useful in the near future, and I hope to be a part of giving the world that gift. When I’m not researching or doing schoolwork, you can find me playing music, video games, or watching movies and foreign shows.
