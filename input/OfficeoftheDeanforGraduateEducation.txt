If it takes off, it could change the way some of us think about our problems. <strong>Robert Morris</strong> grew up in the heart of Silicon Valley, just a few streets away from the garage where Steve Jobs got his start. But technology wasn&#8217;t his passion. The only operating system he really cared about was the human mind. After getting his undergraduate degree from Princeton in psychology, Morris moved on to MIT for PhD work on how to make mental health accessible to everyone, where his failure to more than dabble in computer science quickly caught up to him.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Everyone around me was this brilliant coder, and there was this expectation that if I had an idea, I could just whip up a platform instantly to test it, like anyone else,&#8221; Morris remembers. He began getting depressed as he bashed his head against beginner&#8217;s programming mistakes. &#8220;I thought to myself: I&#8217;m a horrible programmer.

It could lead to miniaturized, battery-powered devices for medical and materials imaging, contraband detection, and even geological exploration. Synthetic diamonds with nitrogen vacancies (NVs) — defects that are extremely sensitive to magnetic fields — have long held promise as the basis for efficient, portable magnetometers. A diamond chip about one-twentieth the size of a thumbnail could contain trillions of nitrogen vacancies, each capable of performing its own magnetic-field measurement.</p> <p>The problem has been aggregating all those measurements. Probing a nitrogen vacancy requires zapping it with laser light, which it absorbs and re-emits. The intensity of the emitted light carries information about the vacancy’s magnetic state. The MIT researchers report their new device in the latest issue of <em>Nature Physics</em>. First author on the paper is <strong>Hannah Clevenson</strong>, a graduate student in electrical engineering who is advised by senior authors Englund and Danielle Braje, a physicist at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. <em>Continue reading on <a href="http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2015/better-magnetic-field-detector-0406">MIT News</a>.</em></p> http://odge.mit.edu/2015/04/clevenson-magnet-field-sensor/feed/ 0 Dr. Cato Laurencin on Regenerative Engineering Apr. 9 http://odge.mit.edu/2015/04/cato-laurencin/ http://odge.mit.edu/2015/04/cato-laurencin/#comments Wed, 08 Apr 2015 12:30:52 +0000 Lisa Lozano Events http://odge.mit.edu/?p=21977 The Institute of Medical Engineering and Science’s next Distinguished Speaker, Dr.Cato Laurencin of University of Connecticut will be giving his lecture “Regenerative Engineering: The Theory and Practice of a Next Generation Field” on Thursday, April 9th at 4:30 PM in &#8230; <a href="http://odge.mit.edu/2015/04/cato-laurencin/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a> <p style="text-align: justify;">The Institute of Medical Engineering and Science’s next Distinguished Speaker, Dr.Cato Laurencin of University of Connecticut will be giving his lecture “Regenerative Engineering: The Theory and Practice of a Next Generation Field” on <strong>Thursday, April 9th</strong> at <strong>4:30 PM</strong> in E25-111.   Dr. Laurencin is an MIT alumnus and was named a Huge Hampton Young Fellow during his time in the institute.

I’m confident in saying that all of us have had a rough experience at one time or another with a suitcase or the process of bringing a carry-on bag into the plane just to shove it into a small overhead compartment. Even worse is the possibility of having our luggage lost altogether.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">To help solve this, and many other problems associated with the suitcase aspect of travel, a team of young entrepreneurs created Bluesmart – the world’s first smart-connected suitcase. Their first product is a carry-on bag that allows a traveler to charge their phone up to 6 times, check the weight of their luggage using a built in scale, lock the suitcase remotely via a mobile device, and even track where the bag is at any time. While creating the Bluesmart suitcase, the founding team researched FAA, TSA, and other agency policies and guidelines to make sure that every part of their device would be accepted. “We’ve flown with prototypes of the Bluesmart to many countries and we’ve never experienced any problems,” said co-founder <strong>Brian Chen</strong>. After a year of hard work on the design and research, the startup launched a crowdfunding campaign that put them on the map and provided them with an initial base of funding and customers. <em>Continue reading on <a href="http://under30ceo.com/million-dollar-suitcase-interview-brian-chen-bluesmart/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=million-dollar-suitcase-interview-brian-chen-bluesmart">Under30CEO</a>.</em></p> http://odge.mit.edu/2015/04/chens-bluesmart-suitcase/feed/ 0 MassCPR – CPR Training Free For Grad Students Apr. 9 http://odge.mit.edu/2015/04/masscpr-cpr/ http://odge.mit.edu/2015/04/masscpr-cpr/#comments Mon, 06 Apr 2015 12:30:11 +0000 Lisa Lozano Events http://odge.mit.edu/?p=22132 Receive American Heart Association CPR AED training and certification on Thursday, April 9th, from 6:00 &#8211; 10:00pm in La Sala (W20-202).The training is free for MIT students, and there will be free food and raffle prizes offered throughout the night. &#8230; <a href="http://odge.mit.edu/2015/04/masscpr-cpr/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a> <p style="text-align: justify;">Receive American Heart Association CPR AED training and certification on <strong>Thursday, April 9th</strong>, from <strong>6:00 &#8211; 10:00pm</strong> in La Sala (W20-202).The training is free for MIT students, and there will be free food and raffle prizes offered throughout the night. <a href="http://mit.us8.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=cdee009ad27356d631e8ca5b8&amp;id=e2076ed8ce&amp;e=a3c136bdda" target="_blank">Sign up</a> if you&#8217;re interested or email masscpr15@mit.edu to learn more information about the event. <em>Photo by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/usagrc/" target="_blank">usagrc</a></em></p> http://odge.mit.edu/2015/04/masscpr-cpr/feed/ 0 Meditation Sessions for MIT Community Building http://odge.mit.edu/2015/04/meditation-sessions/ http://odge.mit.edu/2015/04/meditation-sessions/#comments Mon, 06 Apr 2015 12:00:49 +0000 Lisa Lozano Events Student life http://odge.mit.edu/?p=21989 The MIT community is invited to mediation sessions hosted by the MIT Art of Living organization.

You want more answers, but there just isn’t enough time. Sound familiar? Health care engineer <strong>Andrea Ippolito</strong> SDM ’12, ESD ’17 thinks so, too. She uses engineering to tackle large-scale logistical problems, like making it easier for patients to secure doctor’s appointments. “My goal is to energize the health-tech ecosystem through engineering. I want to change the way we architect our health care, and there’s a hunger for improvement,” she says.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Ippolito is an innovator who is working to improve health care through engineering, systems design, and entrepreneurship. At MIT, she’s served as a co-director of <a title="MIT Hacking Medicine" href="http://hackingmedicine.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT Hacking Medicine</a>, where the team has held over 20 hackathons to crack medical problems like these across the world. Her own start-up, <a title="Smart Scheduling website" href="http://www.smartscheduling.io/" target="_blank">Smart Scheduling</a>, emerged from a Hacking Medicine event. Smart Scheduling now has paired with athenahealth to develop software that takes the guesswork out of patient scheduling. It tracks patients to remind them of appointments and predicts future scheduling behavior, maximizing a busy doctor’s time. <em>Continue reading on <a href="http://spectrum.mit.edu/articles/engineering-to-improve-health-care/">MIT Spectrum</a>.</em></p> http://odge.mit.edu/2015/04/ippolito-health-care-issues/feed/ 0 Science Through Dance Apr. 1 http://odge.mit.edu/2015/04/science-through-dance-apr-1/ http://odge.mit.edu/2015/04/science-through-dance-apr-1/#comments Wed, 01 Apr 2015 12:30:01 +0000 Lisa Lozano Events http://odge.mit.edu/?p=21992 Communicating Science at MIT will discuss the idea of learning by moving, how dance is successfully used to illustrate concepts in science, mathematics, and engineering that may be hard to put into words, and the tensions inherent in developing both &#8230; <a href="http://odge.mit.edu/2015/04/science-through-dance-apr-1/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a> <p style="text-align: justify;">Communicating Science at MIT will discuss the idea of learning by moving, how dance is successfully used to illustrate concepts in science, mathematics, and engineering that may be hard to put into words, and the tensions inherent in developing both interesting and scientifically accurate choreography.

Images of these trash piles remained vivid in Adebiyi’s mind in 2010, when she was a graduate student at the MIT Sloan School of Management. So when she took the D-Lab course MAS.665 (Development Ventures), which focuses on launching ventures in developing countries, “Something awoke in me to help solve the issue,” Adebiyi says.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Partnering with classmate Alexandra Fallon MBA ’12, she launched Wecyclers, which now deploys a fleet of cargo bikes to collect recyclables from houses in poor areas of Lagos, in return for rewards. Launched in 2012, the startup has collected more than 600 tons of recyclables, with more than 6,500 households signed on to its program. Each house has about five people, Adebiyi adds, “so we’ve impacted more than 30,000 lives.” <em>Continue reading on <a href="http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2015/wecyclers-cargo-bike-recycling-nigeria-0305?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=Sportsconf2&amp;utm_campaign=News%20at%20MIT%20Sloan%20March%2016%2C%202015">MIT News</a>.</em></p> http://odge.mit.edu/2015/03/adebiyis-wecyclers/feed/ 0 Your Race, Your Pace by Felicia Harris http://odge.mit.edu/2015/03/your-race-your-pace/ http://odge.mit.edu/2015/03/your-race-your-pace/#comments Fri, 27 Mar 2015 12:30:31 +0000 Leo Calderas Professional Development http://odge.mit.edu/?p=21958 “… And no offense, Felicia, but you can tell they were mostly first-generation!” My friend hurled those words out, mid-rant, on the ride home from a very poorly planned fund raiser.

We had purchased tickets in support of a scholarship fund for high-school seniors who had “overcome life-changing obstacles to achieve academic success.” As doctoral students who had done just that, we were looking forward to networking with other young professionals on behalf of a good cause near and dear to our hearts.

The time elevated Paulsen into the stratosphere of elite female runners like Shalane Flanagan, who won the bronze medal in the women’s 10,000-meter race at the 2008 Olympic games. Flanagan’s best marathon time is 2:21:14.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Paulsen ran cross-country and track and field in high school, college, and graduate school.

A lot has been written about diversity (or the lack thereof) in tech. It is not surprising or even enlightening anymore to learn that women only make up an average of 30% of the workforce in tech firms. Even worse, less than 10% are in actual engineering positions. The numbers are equally bad for other minorities like hispanics and blacks. The majority of Silicon Valley’s workforce is made up of whites or asians with other races barely making a guest appearance. It is sad that none of this is breaking news anymore. It is the bare truth – plain and simple.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">But here is the silver lining – something is actively being done about it. All major firms now have diversity initiatives in place and there is a real movement around diversity happening around the country with organizations like Girls Who Code, Black Star Launch, and Lesbians Who Tech.

MIT Sloan student <strong>Tristan Jackson</strong>’s ambition is to neutralize much of that waste—and generate renewable energy—through his startup, Kanoot. “Most of the landfills in the developing world receive and store waste, but do not process or eliminate it,” said Jackson, MBA ’15. Kanoot sells a mix of microbes capable of digesting organic toxins and producing useful outputs, such as methane fuel.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">While still in the early stages of development, the company is in negotiations with a landfill in Panama to use Kanoot’s technology to boost methane production for a planned 8.1 megawatt gas-fired electrical generator. “Kanoot microbes can boost methane production between 20 percent and 300 percent depending on the exact composition of the waste,” Jackson said. “This project will stop millions of gallons of toxic sludge from contaminating the surrounding area, greatly reduce atmospheric methane emissions, and produce megawatts of renewable energy.” <em>Read more about Jackson&#8217;s startup, Kanoot, on the MIT Sloan School of Management <a href="http://mitsloan.mit.edu/newsroom/2015-bioremediation-microbes-kanoot.php" target="_blank">Newsroom</a>.</em></p> http://odge.mit.edu/2015/03/jackson-kanoot/feed/ 0 Apply for Lemann Education Fellowships by Apr. 1 http://odge.mit.edu/2015/03/lemann-education-fellowships/ http://odge.mit.edu/2015/03/lemann-education-fellowships/#comments Fri, 20 Mar 2015 12:30:20 +0000 Leo Calderas Competitions Brazil funding Grant Lemann Fellowship http://odge.mit.edu/?p=21433 A generous gift from the Jorge Paulo Lemann Foundation has created a pilot program to support Lemann Education Fellowships at MIT.

Understanding the sources of methane, and how the gas is formed, could give scientists a better understanding of its role in warming the planet.

The team, led by Kerri Cahoy, an assistant professor of aeronautics and astronautics at MIT, has already used the method to determine the properties of clouds on the exoplanet Kepler-7b. The planet is known as a “hot Jupiter,” as temperatures in its atmosphere hover at around 1,700 kelvins.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Researchers have previously shown that by studying the variations in the amount of light coming from these star systems as a planet transits, or crosses in front or behind them, they can detect the presence of clouds in that planet’s atmosphere. That is because particles within the clouds will scatter different wavelengths of light. To find out if this data could be used to determine the composition of these clouds, the MIT researchers studied the light signal from Kepler-7b. They used models of the temperature and pressure of the planet’s atmosphere to determine how different types of clouds would form within it, says lead author <strong>Matthew Webber</strong>, a graduate student in Cahoy’s group at MIT. <em>Continue reading on <a href="http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2015/clouds-around-exoplanets-0303">MIT News</a>.</em></p> http://odge.mit.edu/2015/03/webber-exoplanet-clouds/feed/ 0 Women in STEM Mar. 17 http://odge.mit.edu/2015/03/women-in-stem/ http://odge.mit.edu/2015/03/women-in-stem/#comments Mon, 16 Mar 2015 12:30:47 +0000 Lisa Lozano Professional Development http://odge.mit.edu/?p=21517 The MIT Global Education and Career Development office has put together a seminar aimed to help women succeed in STEM fields.
