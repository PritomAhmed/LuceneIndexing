You will serve as a voting member of a committee which advises faculty and administration, and ultimately reports to the MIT President. During the Spring/Summer, these positions are relatively open, which makes this the best time to apply for the committee of your choice. Representative Responsibilities Presidential/Faculty Committee Representatives should attend the General Council Meetings (first Wednesday of every month, 5:30pm) both to learn about issues the graduate student body faces and to disseminate information. More formal reporting should be done to the GSC Standing Committee to which the Presidential/Faculty Committee pertains and through the Institute Representative Reporting Form. Lastly, all Presidential/Faculty Committee Representatives will be expected to submit an end-of-year report summarizing the actions and issues of their committee during their tenure.
