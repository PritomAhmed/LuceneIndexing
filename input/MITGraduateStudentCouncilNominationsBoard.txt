These committees are responsible for many of the decisions that affect the way MIT operates on a day to day basis, and provide a very important opportunity for graduate students to provide input and feedback. The Presidential and Faculty Committees with graduate student representation may be found on the GSC website. The Nominations Board is chaired by the GSC Vice President, and consists of members of the GSC and the general graduate community. Information on the Nominations Board may be found in the Article II.C.2 of the GSC Bylaws. 2014/2015 Institute Committee Rep Application - View All Open Positions and Application Forms   How Nominations Work Nominations open at the end of the Spring term, generally near the beginning of May. The deadline for the applications varies according to the committee; please, review the Institute Committees description through the link above for more information. Students submit their Application for Nomination to Presidential and Faculty Committees to the GSC Vice President, who convenes the Nominations Board to interview candidates over the course of the summer. Based on the application and interview, the Nominations Board will rank all applicants for a particular committee and then submit the top applications to that Institute Committee’s Chair. The Chair of the Institute Committee then determines which nominee(s) will fill the position(s) based either on the GSC rankings or an internal review process. Nomination by the GSC is not a guarantee of appointment, as the Institute Committees make the final decision and notification to accept a candidate. However, all candidates for graduate student representative positions must go through the GSC nomination process. For any question that can not be answered by this website, please contact:  gsc-nominations@mit.edu Reporting Relationships All Institute Committee representatives are expected to maintain communication with the chairs of the appropriate GSC Committee.
