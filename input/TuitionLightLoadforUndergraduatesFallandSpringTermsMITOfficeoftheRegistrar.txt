The student's advisor must approve the Light Load Form. The form is optional for fourth-year students registering for thesis only, or who are or will be on the degree list for the term, as tuition is adjusted automatically after Drop Date. If the form is submitted to the Registrar's Office, 5-119, by Thursday, July 3, light load tuition will appear on the first fall term bill. Students are charged on a per unit basis for all subjects including those taken as a Listener and are charged on a pro-rated basis for subjects dropped during the term. The light load option is not available to students who are (or were) in internship and cooperative programs. See Registration Load for possible consequences if taking fewer than 36 units.
